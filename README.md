# My First Kotlin Android App 👋

A simple greeting app built with Jetpack Compose to start my Android development journey!

## What's Inside ✨
- A welcome screen with greeting message
- A counter screen with clickable button
- Beautiful colors and fonts
- Made with Kotlin

## Screens 📱
| Welcome Screen | Counter Screen |
|----------------|----------------|
| <img width="412" height="238" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db8b3a9c-4ef8-4faf-83fe-d6da4fa3a509" /> | <img width="412" height="238" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff17a9ca-0b54-427c-8ef0-10cf04f0b7c2" /> |
