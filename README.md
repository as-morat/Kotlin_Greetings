# My First Kotlin Android App 👋

A simple greeting app built with Jetpack Compose to start my Android development journey!

## What's Inside ✨
- A welcome screen with greeting message
- A counter screen with clickable button
- Beautiful colors and fonts
- Made with ❤️ using Kotlin

## Screens 📱
| Welcome Screen | Counter Screen |
|----------------|----------------|
| <img width="411" height="305" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2424dca2-e986-40aa-b86f-f8b30e3e4938" />| <img width="411" height="305" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01d86d27-151f-4be2-84df-caa62f9b0d83" /> |
