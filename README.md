# My First Kotlin Android App 👋

A simple greeting app built with Jetpack Compose to start my Android development journey!

## What's Inside ✨
- A welcome screen with greeting message
- A counter screen with clickable button
- Beautiful colors and fonts
- Made with ❤️ using Kotlin

## Screens 📱
| Welcome Screen | Counter Screen |
|----------------|----------------|
| ![Welcome]<img width="400" height="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30d64fea-6b1d-4dd4-ba65-8adbae54a862" />
